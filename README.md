The proudest work: 
* **project 8 LYtanker (took me a week to complete)**  
  It is a game, which consists of some square shapes.  
  2 players control different tanks to attack each other.  
  Use keyboard(WSAD & num 8546) to move the tanks and to fire(j & +).  


* **project 5 LYdriveTogether (took me a night to complete)**  
  It is a game. I think that it is very innovative.  
  You can control 2 cars at the same time.  
  Character "1" stands for cars. Character "#" stands for obstacles.  
  But different cars have different obstacles.  
  What is more, the control(keyboard j & k) direction is symmetrical.  
  There is always a way without obstacles.

The most useful work: 
* **project 6 LYpressButtonPractice**  
  Just press the button which is always in motion!  
  Double click the number to start. The caption will record your scores.  
  It will help you do better performance in FPS games.  
  
* **project 1 LYrandomNumber**  
  Generate random numbers.
